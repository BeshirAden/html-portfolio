    However, life has a way of presenting new opportunities, and I found myself drawn to the dynamic 
    world of web development. With an innate curiosity and a desire to learn, I made the bold decision 
    to pivot my career path. The prospect of creating interactive and visually appealing digital experiences 
    that could reach a global audience captured my imagination.
